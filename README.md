# INTRODUCTION
Hello, firstly thank you for visiting my github it means a lot to me that you would show interest in what I have created. This 'ASL APP' is a mobile web application that I am developing to teach American sign language.

# HOW TO USE IT
Currently it is not aviable on the IOS store or android/google play store, you can either run the application on an enviroment that has an embedded emulator or that supports emulators, running the main.dart file located in the lib folder.
